            Sebastian, or <i>basboosa</i> like how my mom likes to call him is
            our kitten. He is 6 months old and very moody. He thinks he is the
            king of the world but it's time for food he becomes the cutest pet
            even so would give him more food.

        <h2>Random facts about cats</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The oldest known pet cat existed 9,500 years ago</li>
          <p>
            This interesting fact about cats is guaranteed to wow at your next
            dinner party. Did you know that originally it was thought that
            Egyptians domesticated the cat? But in 2004, French archaeologists
            discovered a 9,500 year old cat grave in Cyprus. This makes this the
            oldest known pet cat and it predates Egyptian art about cats by over
            4,000 years!
          </p>
          <li>Cats spend 70% of their lives sleeping</li>
          <p>
            If you thought cats spent a lot of their lives sleeping, you’d be
            right. According to Veterinary Hub, Cats actually spend 70% of their
            lives sleeping, which works out to around 13-16 hours a day. It’s a
            cat’s life!
          </p>
          <li>A cat was the Mayor of an Alaskan town for 20 years</li>
          <p>
            An orange tabby cat called Stubbs was the mayor of Talkeetna, a
            small town in Alaska for 20 years! He had several uncontested
            elections and although he didn’t hold any legislative power, he was
            loved by locals and tourists alike.
          </p>
          <li>The record for the longest cat ever is 48.5 inches</li>
          <p>
            Domestic cats are usually considered to be quite small and dainty
            creatures. But did you know the world’s longest cat was a Maine Coon
            called Stewie, and was measured at 48.5 inches? Whereas, the record
            for the tallest cat belonged to Arcturus at a whopping 19.05 inches
            tall! Those are some big cats.
          </p>
          <li>The richest cat in the world had £7 million</li>
          <p>
            The richest cat in the world according to Guinness World Records is
            Blackie. When his millionaire owner passed away he refused to
            recognise his family in his will and instead gave his
            7-million-pound fortune to Blackie! We can’t believe that
            interesting cat fact!
